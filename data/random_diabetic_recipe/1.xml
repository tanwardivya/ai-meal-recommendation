  Spinach and Feta Breakfast Scramble
 </recipe_name>
 <ingredients>
  4 large eggs, 2 large egg whites, 2 tablespoons water, 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese, 2 cups fresh spinach, roughly chopped, 1/2 cup diced tomatoes, 2 tablespoons chopped chives, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, 1 tablespoon olive oil
 </ingredients>
 <directions>
  In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, egg whites, and water until well combined. Stir in the feta cheese, spinach, tomatoes, chives, and pepper, and set aside. Heat the olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Pour the egg mixture into the skillet. Let it sit, without stirring, for about 20 seconds. Start scrambling the eggs, folding them over from the bottom and the sides of the skillet. Continue to cook and scramble until the eggs are just set but still soft. Remove from heat immediately to prevent overcooking. Serve the scramble hot.
