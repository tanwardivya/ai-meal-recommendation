 </recipe_name>
 <ingredients>
  2 large eggs, 1/4 cup chopped spinach, 1 tablespoon crumbled feta cheese, 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon olive oil, 1 tablespoon diced tomatoes, 1 tablespoon chopped red onion, Fresh herbs for garnish (optional)
 </ingredients>
 <directions>
  In a small bowl, beat the eggs with the dried oregano and black pepper. Set aside. Heat the olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Saut√© the chopped red onion until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the chopped spinach and diced tomatoes and cook until the spinach is wilted, about 1-2 minutes. Pour in the beaten eggs. Cook for a few minutes until the eggs start to set at the edges. Sprinkle the crumbled feta cheese over half of the omelette. Using a spatula, gently fold the other half over the cheese. Continue cooking for another minute or until the feta is slightly melted and the eggs are cooked to your liking. Slide the omelette onto a plate and garnish with fresh herbs if desired. Serve immediately.
