  Veggie-Packed Frittata
 </recipe_name>
 <ingredients>
  6 large eggs, 1/4 cup skim milk, 1/2 cup diced bell peppers, 1/2 cup diced onions, 1 cup chopped spinach, 1/2 cup chopped mushrooms, 1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, 2 tablespoons olive oil
 </ingredients>
 <directions>
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large mixing bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, salt, and pepper until well combined. Stir in bell peppers, onions, spinach, mushrooms, and feta cheese. Heat olive oil in a 10-inch oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the egg mixture to the skillet and cook for 5-7 minutes until the edges begin to firm up. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the frittata is fully set and the top is lightly golden. Remove from oven, let it cool for a few minutes, then slice and serve.
