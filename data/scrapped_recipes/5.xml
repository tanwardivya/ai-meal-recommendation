 </recipe_name>
 <ingredients>
  1 can (15 ounces) chickpeas, rinsed and drained, 1/2 cup diced cucumber, 1/2 cup diced red bell pepper, 1/4 cup chopped red onion, 1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese (optional for vegan diets), 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 teaspoon dried oregano, Salt and pepper to taste, 4 whole-grain or low-carb tortillas
 </ingredients>
 <directions>
  In a large bowl, combine chickpeas, cucumber, bell pepper, red onion, and feta cheese if using. In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, oregano, salt, and pepper. Pour the dressing over the chickpea mixture and toss until evenly coated. Spread the chickpea salad onto the center of each tortilla, distributing evenly. Fold in the sides of the tortilla and roll it up tightly to enclose the filling. Wrap the prepared wraps in foil or parchment paper for easy on-the-go lunch options. Store in the refrigerator until ready to eat.
