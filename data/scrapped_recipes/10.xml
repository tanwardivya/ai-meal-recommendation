 </ingredients>
 <directions>
  In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the almond flour, baking powder, sweetener, and salt. In another bowl, beat the eggs, then add the water, oil, and vanilla extract and mix well. Combine the wet and dry ingredients until you achieve a smooth batter, Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly coat with cooking spray or a little oil. Pour 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until the edges are set and bubbles form on the surface, about 2 to 3 minutes, then flip and cook the other side for an additional 1 to 2 minutes or until golden brown and cooked through. Serve warm with your choice of diabetic-friendly toppings like fresh berries or sugar-free syrup.
