 <directions>
  Begin by preparing your serving glasses. Rub the rim of each glass with a lime wedge and dip it in Tajín seasoning to coat.
In a blender, combine the ice, chopped mango, chamoy sauce, lime juice, and sugar (if using). Blend until the mixture reaches a slushy consistency.
Pour a small amount of chamoy sauce onto a small plate. Dip the rim of each glass into the chamoy to coat the edge.
Fill the glasses with the blended chamoyada mixture.
Top each glass with additional chamoy sauce if desired.
Garnish with a lime wedge on the rim, fresh mango chunks, and optionally, a tamarind candy straw.
Serve immediately and enjoy your refreshing Chamoyada!
