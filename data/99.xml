  Easy Apple Cider
 </title>
 <ingredients>
  10 medium-sized apples, assorted types (like Fuji, Gala, Honeycrisp), quartered, 
½ orange, quartered (leave peel on),
4 sticks of cinnamon, 
1 teaspoon whole cloves, 
1 nutmeg, halved, 
10 cups water, 
½ to 1 cup granulated sugar (depending on desired sweetness),
Optional: additional cinnamon sticks for serving.
 </ingredients>
 <directions>
  Place the quartered apples and orange pieces into a large pot. Add the cinnamon sticks, whole cloves, and nutmeg. Pour in the water—the water should cover the fruit, but it's okay if a few pieces poke out above the water.
Bring the pot to a boil. Boil uncovered for about one hour, checking occasionally. You want to make sure it doesn't boil down too much. If the water gets low, add more to cover the fruit.
After boiling for an hour, cover the pot, reduce the heat, and simmer the apple cider for another two hours.
Use a potato masher or a large spoon to mash the apples and orange down to release more flavor.
Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or cheese cloth into a clean container. Use the back of a spoon to press the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the solids.
Stir in ½ cup of sugar, taste and add more if desired.
Serve the cider hot with optional additional cinnamon sticks for garnish. The cider can be kept in the refrigerator for up to five days or frozen for later use.
