  1. Sauté Vegetables: In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions, carrots, and celery, and sauté until they are softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for another minute.
2. Add Lentils and Simmer: Stir in the lentils, diced tomatoes, smoked paprika, thyme, black pepper, and bay leaf. Add 4 cups of water and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 25 to 30 minutes, or until the lentils are tender.
3. Finish with Spinach: If using spinach, stir it into the stew until wilted, just before serving.
4. Adjust Seasonings and Serve: Remove the bay leaf. Taste and adjust the seasonings, if necessary. Serve hot.
