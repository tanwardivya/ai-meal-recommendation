 </recipe_name>
 <ingredients>
  - all-purpose flour: 3 cups
- instant yeast: 1 packet (about 2 1/4 teaspoons)
- honey: 1 tablespoon
- olive oil: 2 tablespoons
- warm water: 1 cup (approximately 110°F)
- unsalted butter (for greasing): 1 tablespoon
 </ingredients>
 <directions>
  1. Activate Yeast: In a large bowl, combine warm water, instant yeast, and honey. Stir well until the yeast is dissolved. Let it sit for about 10 minutes, or until it becomes frothy.
2. Prep Dough: Add all-purpose flour and olive oil to the yeast mixture. Stir with a wooden spoon until a dough begins to form.
3. Knead Dough: Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for approximately 10 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic.
4. First Rise: Grease a clean bowl with unsalted butter and place the dough in the bowl. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
5. Shape and Second Rise: Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Shape it into a loaf and place it in a greased loaf pan. Cover and let rise again for about 30 minutes.
6. Bake: Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the bread for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped.
7. Cool: Remove the loaf from the oven and let it cool on a rack before slicing.
