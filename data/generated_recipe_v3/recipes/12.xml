 <directions>
  1. Prepare Quinoa: Rinse the quinoa under cold water. In a medium saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Add quinoa, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until quinoa is tender and water is absorbed. Remove from heat, fluff with a fork, and let it cool slightly.
2. Grill Salmon: Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Brush salmon fillets with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill salmon for about 6 minutes per side or until fully cooked and flakes easily with a fork.
3. Make Salad: In a large bowl, combine the cooled quinoa, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, kalamata olives, feta cheese, and red onion.
4. Prepare Dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, chopped parsley, minced garlic, salt, and black pepper.
5. Combine and Serve: Pour dressing over the quinoa salad and toss to combine. Serve the grilled salmon on top of or alongside the Mediterranean quinoa salad.
