  1. Prepare Apples: In a large bowl, toss the sliced apples with lemon juice, granulated sweetener, and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.
2. Arrange Apples: Transfer the apple mixture to a greased baking dish.
3. Make Crisp Topping: In another bowl, mix the rolled oats, whole wheat flour, brown sugar substitute, remaining cinnamon, and melted butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
