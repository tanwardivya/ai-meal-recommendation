  1. Marinate Chicken: In a small bowl, combine olive oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, minced garlic, oregano, thyme, rosemary, and black pepper. Place chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag and pour the marinade over the chicken. Seal the bag and make sure the chicken is well-coated. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to 4 hours.
2. Grill Chicken: Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade, discarding any remaining marinade. Grill the chicken for about 6-7 minutes per side, or until the chicken is cooked through and has internal temperature of 165°F (74°C).
3. Rest and Serve: Let the chicken rest for a few minutes after grilling. Serve with a side of steamed vegetables or a fresh salad.
