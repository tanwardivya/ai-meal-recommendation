 <directions>
  1. Prepare Cauliflower: Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Remove the stems and leaves from the cauliflower and chop the florets into chunks. Place them in a food processor and pulse it until the texture of rice.
2. Cook Cauliflower: Transfer the riced cauliflower to a microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 5 minutes. Let it cool, then squeeze out all the excess moisture with a tea towel.
3. Make Dough: In a bowl, combine the cooked cauliflower with 1 egg, 1 cup mozzarella, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper. Mix well.
4. Shape and Bake Crust: Line a pizza tray or a baking sheet with parchment paper and grease it with olive oil. Press the cauliflower mixture into a round shape to create a pizza crust. Bake for 20 minutes until golden.
5. Add Toppings: Spread sugar-free pizza sauce over the baked crust, then top with bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, olives, and additional 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese.
6. Bake Pizza: Return the pizza to the oven and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the cheese is melty and bubbly.
7. Cool and Serve: Let the pizza cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.
