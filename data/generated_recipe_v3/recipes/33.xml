  1. Press Tofu: Wrap the tofu in a clean kitchen towel and place a heavy object on top. Leave it for about 15-20 minutes to press out excess moisture.
    2. Prepare Tofu: Cut the pressed tofu into cubes. In a small bowl, mix cornstarch and water until smooth. Toss the tofu cubes in the cornstarch mixture.
    3. Cook Tofu: In a large skillet or wok, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add tofu cubes and stir-fry until golden and crispy. Remove tofu from the skillet and set aside.
    4. Stir-Fry Vegetables: In the same skillet, add a bit more oil if needed. Add garlic, onion, and carrots, and stir-fry for about 2 minutes. Add broccoli and bell pepper, continue to stir-fry until vegetables are tender but still crisp.
    5. Combine Ingredients: Return the tofu to the skillet. Add soy sauce and sesame oil, stir well to coat everything evenly.
    6. Garnish and Serve: Sprinkle with chopped green onions and sesame seeds before serving.
