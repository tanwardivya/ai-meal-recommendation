  1. Cook Quinoa: Rinse quinoa thoroughly under cold water. In a saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Add quinoa, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is cooked and water is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Then fluff with a fork and set aside to cool.
2. Prepare Veggies: In a large bowl, combine cherry tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, carrots, and spinach. Toss these vegetables gently.
3. Make Dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together lemon juice, olive oil, garlic powder, dried oregano, and pepper.
