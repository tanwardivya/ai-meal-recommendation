 </recipe_name>
 <ingredients>
  - unsweetened almond milk: 2 cups
- coconut cream: 1 cup
- pure vanilla extract: 2 teaspoons
- maple syrup: 1/2 cup
- cornstarch: 2 tablespoons
- salt: 1/4 teaspoon
 </ingredients>
 <directions>
  1. Mix Ingredients: In a medium saucepan, combine the almond milk, coconut cream, maple syrup, cornstarch, and salt. Whisk them together until the cornstarch is fully dissolved.
2. Cook: Place the saucepan over medium heat. Cook the mixture, stirring constantly, until it begins to thicken slightly and just begins to bubble. Then remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract.
3. Chill: Transfer the mixture to a bowl and cover it with plastic wrap, pressing the wrap directly onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, until very cold.
4. Process: Pour the chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions until it reaches the consistency of soft-serve ice cream.
5. Freeze: Transfer the ice cream to an airtight container and freeze for at least 2 hours or until firm.
6. Serve: Scoop and enjoy the Low-Cholesterol Vanilla Ice Cream.
