 <directions>
  1. Prepare Marinade: In a small bowl, combine lemon juice, 1 tablespoon olive oil, minced garlic, oregano, and basil. Whisk them together thoroughly.
2. Marinate Chicken: Place chicken breasts in a shallow dish or a resealable plastic bag. Pour the marinade over the chicken, ensuring it is well-coated. Refrigerate and let marinate for at least 1 hour, preferably longer.
3. Grill Chicken: Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Remove chicken from the marinade, letting excess drip off. Grill chicken for 6-7 minutes per side or until fully cooked and juices run clear. Remove from grill and let rest for a few minutes before slicing.
4. Assemble Salad: In a large salad bowl, toss together mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, feta cheese, and black olives. Drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil.
5. Serve: Slice grilled chicken and place on top of the salad. Serve immediately for the best flavor.
