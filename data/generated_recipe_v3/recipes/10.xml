 <directions>
  1. Heat Oil: In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and allow them to sizzle for a few seconds.
2. Sauté Veggies: Add the chopped onions, minced garlic, and grated ginger. Sauté until the onions turn translucent and the raw smell of garlic and ginger goes away.
3. Add Spices: Stir in garam masala, turmeric, coriander powder, red chili powder, and salt. Mix well and cook for about a minute to allow the spices to release their flavors.
4. Mix Chickpeas and Tomatoes: Add the rinsed chickpeas and diced tomatoes to the skillet. Stir well, ensuring that the chickpeas are coated with the spice mixture.
5. Add Coconut Milk: Pour in the coconut milk and mix well. Bring the curry to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for 10-15 minutes until the curry thickens.
6. Garnish and Serve: Remove from heat and garnish with chopped fresh cilantro. Serve hot with basmati rice or naan bread.
