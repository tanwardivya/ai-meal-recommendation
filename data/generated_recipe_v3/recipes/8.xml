  Cauliflower Crust Pizza
 </recipe_name>
 <ingredients>
  - Cauliflower: 1 head (about 2 pounds, to make 3 cups riced)
- Egg: 1 large
- Mozzarella cheese (part-skim, shredded): 1/2 cup
- Parmesan cheese (grated): 1/4 cup
- Italian seasoning: 1 teaspoon
- Salt: 1/4 teaspoon
- Garlic powder: 1/4 teaspoon
- Toppings (sliced bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, spinach): as desired
- Tomato sauce (no sugar added): 1/2 cup
- Additional mozzarella for topping: 1/2 cup
 </ingredients>
 <directions>
  1. Prepare Cauliflower: Wash and dry the cauliflower, then cut off the florets (you don’t need much stem). Pulse in a food processor until you achieve a rice-like texture.
2. Cook Cauliflower: Microwave the riced cauliflower in a bowl for about 4-5 minutes, stir, then let it cool. Once cool, use a clean kitchen towel to squeeze out as much moisture as possible.
3. Make Dough: In a bowl, combine the drained cauliflower with egg, 1/2 cup mozzarella, Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, salt, and garlic powder. Mix well to create a dough.
4. Shape and Bake Crust: Preheat oven to 425°F. Spread the dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and shape into a round pizza crust, about 1/4 inch thick. Bake for 10-15 minutes until golden.
5. Add Toppings: Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the baked crust, then add your desired toppings and additional mozzarella cheese.
6. Bake Pizza: Return to the oven and bake for 10-15 minutes until the toppings are cooked and the cheese is melted and bubbling.
7. Cool and Serve: Let the pizza cool for a few minutes before cutting and serving.
