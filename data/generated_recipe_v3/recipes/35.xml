 <ingredients>
  - mixed berries (blueberries, strawberries, raspberries): 2 cups (fresh or frozen)
- Greek yogurt (unsweetened): 1 cup
- almond milk (unsweetened): 1 cup
- spinach: 1 cup
- chia seeds: 1 tablespoon
- vanilla extract: 1 teaspoon
- ice cubes (optional): 1/2 cup
 </ingredients>
 <directions>
  1. Prepare Ingredients: If using fresh berries, wash them thoroughly. If using frozen berries, there is no need to thaw them as they will help make the smoothie cold and thick.
2. Combine Ingredients: In a blender, combine the mixed berries, Greek yogurt, almond milk, spinach, chia seeds, vanilla extract, and ice cubes if desired.
3. Blend: Blend on high until the mixture is smooth and creamy. If the smoothie is too thick, you can add a bit more almond milk to reach your desired consistency.
4. Serve: Pour into glasses and serve immediately for the freshest taste and best texture.
