  Pavlova Deluxe
 </title>
 <ingredients>
  4 large egg whites (room temperature), 1 cup superfine sugar, 1 teaspoon white vinegar, 1 teaspoon cornstarch, 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, 1 cup heavy cream, 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar (plus more for dusting), 2 cups mixed berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, etc.), mint leaves for garnish (optional)
 </ingredients>
 <directions>
  Preheat oven to 300째F (150째C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Draw a 9-inch circle on the parchment paper as a guide for the Pavlova base.
In a clean, dry bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually add the superfine sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a time, continuing to beat until the egg whites are glossy and stiff peaks form. 
Whisk in the cornstarch, vinegar, and vanilla extract until just combined.
Spoon the meringue onto the center of the circle on the parchment paper. Using a spatula or the back of a spoon, shape the meringue into a disc, keeping within the circle and creating a slight well in the center.
Place in the oven and reduce the temperature to 250째F (120째C). Bake for 60 minutes, or until the meringue is crisp on the outside and dry on the inside. Turn off the oven, leave the door ajar, and allow the Pavlova to cool completely inside.
Before serving, whip the heavy cream with the confectioners' sugar until soft peaks form. Spoon the whipped cream into the well of the cooled meringue. Top with mixed berries and dust with additional confectioners' sugar. Garnish with mint leaves if desired. Serve immediately.
