  Spicy Mango Sauce
 </title>
 <ingredients>
  2 ripe mangoes, peeled and pitted, 1 small red chili (like a serrano or Thai chili), seeds removed and minced, 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice, 2 teaspoons honey, or to taste, 1 small clove garlic, minced, 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin, 1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste, 2 tablespoons freshly chopped cilantro, Optional: 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
 </ingredients>
 <directions>
  In a food processor or blender, combine the mangoes, minced chili, lime juice, honey, garlic, cumin, and salt. Blend until smooth.
Taste and adjust the seasoning, adding more honey if it’s too tart or more salt if necessary. If you've opted for ginger, blend it in as well.
Pour the sauce into a bowl and stir in the chopped cilantro. If you’d like a thinner consistency, mix in a little water until desired thickness is reached.
Let the sauce sit for at least 30 minutes before serving to allow the flavors to meld together. This sauce can be used immediately or stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
Serve the spicy mango sauce with grilled chicken, fish, tacos, or as a dipping sauce for spring rolls or crudité.
