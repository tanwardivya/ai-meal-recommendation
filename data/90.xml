  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 12 cup muffin pan or line with paper muffin liners.
In a medium bowl, mix together 2 cups of flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. Set aside.
In a large bowl, beat together butter, white sugar, and eggs until smooth. Mix in vanilla extract. Stir in the chopped apples, and gradually blend in the flour mixture. Spoon the mixture into the prepared muffin pan.
In a small bowl, mix brown sugar, 1 tablespoon of flour, and 1/8 teaspoon of cinnamon. Cut in 1 tablespoon of butter until mixture is like coarse crumbs. Sprinkle over the tops of the mixture in the muffin pan.
Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean. Allow to sit for 5 minutes before removing muffins from pan. Cool on a wire rack.
