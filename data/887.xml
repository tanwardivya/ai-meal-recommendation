  Homemade Energy Bars
 </title>
 <ingredients>
  1 cup rolled oats, 
1/2 cup raw almonds, chopped, 
1/2 cup dried cranberries, 
1/4 cup pumpkin seeds, 
1/4 cup sunflower seeds, 
1/4 cup honey, 
1/4 cup peanut butter or almond butter, 
1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 
A pinch of salt
 </ingredients>
 <directions>
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper, leaving some overhang for easy removal.
Spread the oats and almonds on a baking sheet and toast in the oven for about 10 minutes, until lightly browned and fragrant.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the toasted oats and almonds, dried cranberries, pumpkin seeds, and sunflower seeds.
In a small saucepan over medium heat, stir together the honey, peanut butter or almond butter, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt. Heat until the mixture is well combined and slightly runny.
Pour the warm honey mixture over the dry ingredients in the bowl. Mix thoroughly until all ingredients are well coated.
Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking pan. Press firmly into an even layer, using the bottom of a measuring cup or your hands to compact it well (this helps the bars stick together).
Bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.
Let the bars cool completely in the pan on a wire rack. Once cool, use the parchment overhang to lift the bars from the pan. Cut into squares or rectangles as desired.
