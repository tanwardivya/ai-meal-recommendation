 <directions>
  1. Sauté Vegetables: In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onions and cook until translucent. Add garlic, carrots, and celery, and sauté for another 5 minutes.
2. Add Lentils and Liquids: Stir in the green lentils and the can of diced tomatoes (with their juice). Pour in the vegetable broth and water. Increase the heat to bring the mixture to a boil.
3. Simmer the Soup: Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, and add thyme and rosemary. Cover the pot and simmer for about 25-30 minutes, or until the lentils are tender.
4. Season and Finish: Add the fresh spinach and cook for an additional 5 minutes until it wilts. Season with salt and black pepper. Squeeze in fresh lemon juice for added zest, and stir.
5. Serve: Ladle the soup into bowls. For an extra touch, garnish with fresh herbs or a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese (optional for non-vegan diets).
