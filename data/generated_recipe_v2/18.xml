 <directions>
  1. Prepare the Zucchini Noodles: Wash the zucchinis and use a spiralizer to create noodles. Set aside in a colander to drain any excess moisture.
2. Make the Pesto: In a food processor or blender, combine the basil leaves, garlic, Parmesan cheese, pine nuts (if using), lemon juice, and salt and pepper. Pulse until coarsely chopped. While processing, slowly add the olive oil in a steady stream until the pesto comes together into a thick paste.
3. Toast Pine Nuts (if using): Place pine nuts in a dry skillet over medium heat and cook, stirring often, until golden and fragrant. Set aside to cool.
4. Combine the Dish: In a large bowl, toss the zucchini noodles with the pesto until they are well coated. Gently stir in the cherry tomatoes and toasted pine nuts.
5. Serve: Serve immediately or chill in the refrigerator for an hour to allow flavors to meld. Adjust seasoning with more salt and pepper if needed.
