 <directions>
  1. Make Zucchini Noodles: Using a spiralizer, turn the zucchini into noodles. Pat dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture.
2. Prepare Pesto: In a food processor, blend the basil leaves, pine nuts, garlic, Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper until smooth. Gradually add the olive oil while continuing to blend until a creamy consistency is reached.
3. Toast Pine Nuts: In a dry skillet, toast the pine nuts over medium heat until golden brown, stirring frequently to prevent burning.
4. Combine Noodles with Pesto: Toss the zucchini noodles with the prepared pesto in a large bowl until well coated.
5. Serve: Top with toasted pine nuts and halved cherry tomatoes. Serve immediately or chilled.
