 <directions>
  1. Prepare Ingredients: Wash the spinach leaves, cucumber, celery, and green apple. Chop the cucumber and celery into chunks that will blend easily. Core and slice the green apple.
2. Blend Greens: In a high-powered blender, add the spinach, cucumber, celery, and green apple. Blend until the greens are finely chopped and start to become smooth.
3. Add Flavors and Liquids: Add the grated ginger, lemon juice, almond milk, and chia seeds (if using) to the blender.
4. Blend Until Smooth: Add ice cubes to the mixture and blend on high speed until you have a smooth consistency. If the smoothie is too thick, you can add a little more almond milk to thin it to your preference.
5. Serve Immediately: Pour the green veggie smoothie into glasses and enjoy immediately for the best flavor and nutrient value.
