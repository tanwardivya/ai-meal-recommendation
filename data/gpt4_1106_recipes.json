            "ingredients": "1 pie crust (store-bought or homemade), 6 cups thinly sliced apples (such as Granny Smith or a combination of tart and sweet apples), 3/4 cup granulated sugar, 2 tbsp all-purpose flour, 1 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg, 1/4 tsp salt, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 cup unsalted butter (cold and cut into small pieces), 3/4 cup all-purpose flour (for crumb topping), 1/2 cup brown sugar (packed, for crumb topping), 1/4 tsp baking powder (for crumb topping), 1/4 tsp salt (for crumb topping), Optional: Vanilla ice cream or whipped cream for serving",
            "directions": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place the pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish and crimp the edges as desired.\nIn a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, 2 tbsp flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, 1/4 tsp salt, and vanilla extract. Toss until the apples are evenly coated.\nPour the apple mixture into the pie crust and spread it out evenly.\nIn a separate bowl, prepare the crumb topping by mixing together 3/4 cup flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and 1/4 tsp salt. Add the cold butter pieces and use your fingers, a pastry cutter, or two knives to mix the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.\nSprinkle the crumb topping evenly over the apples in the pie dish.\nPlace the pie on a baking sheet to catch any drips and bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the crumb topping is golden brown and the apple filling is bubbly.\nIf the edges of the crust begin to brown too quickly, cover them with aluminum foil.\nRemove the pie from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream, if desired.",

            "directions": "Place the quartered apples and orange pieces into a large pot. Add the cinnamon sticks, whole cloves, and nutmeg. Pour in the water—the water should cover the fruit, but it's okay if a few pieces poke out above the water.\nBring the pot to a boil. Boil uncovered for about one hour, checking occasionally. You want to make sure it doesn't boil down too much. If the water gets low, add more to cover the fruit.\nAfter boiling for an hour, cover the pot, reduce the heat, and simmer the apple cider for another two hours.\nUse a potato masher or a large spoon to mash the apples and orange down to release more flavor.\nStrain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or cheese cloth into a clean container. Use the back of a spoon to press the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the solids.\nStir in ½ cup of sugar, taste and add more if desired.\nServe the cider hot with optional additional cinnamon sticks for garnish. The cider can be kept in the refrigerator for up to five days or frozen for later use.",
