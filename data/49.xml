  Apple Crumb Pie
 </title>
 <ingredients>
  1 pie crust (store-bought or homemade), 6 cups thinly sliced apples (such as Granny Smith or a combination of tart and sweet apples), 3/4 cup granulated sugar, 2 tbsp all-purpose flour, 1 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg, 1/4 tsp salt, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 cup unsalted butter (cold and cut into small pieces), 3/4 cup all-purpose flour (for crumb topping), 1/2 cup brown sugar (packed, for crumb topping), 1/4 tsp baking powder (for crumb topping), 1/4 tsp salt (for crumb topping), Optional: Vanilla ice cream or whipped cream for serving
 </ingredients>
 <directions>
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place the pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish and crimp the edges as desired.
In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, 2 tbsp flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, 1/4 tsp salt, and vanilla extract. Toss until the apples are evenly coated.
Pour the apple mixture into the pie crust and spread it out evenly.
In a separate bowl, prepare the crumb topping by mixing together 3/4 cup flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and 1/4 tsp salt. Add the cold butter pieces and use your fingers, a pastry cutter, or two knives to mix the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Sprinkle the crumb topping evenly over the apples in the pie dish.
Place the pie on a baking sheet to catch any drips and bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the crumb topping is golden brown and the apple filling is bubbly.
If the edges of the crust begin to brown too quickly, cover them with aluminum foil.
Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream, if desired.
