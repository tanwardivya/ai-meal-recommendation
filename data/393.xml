  Banana Peach Bread
 </title>
 <ingredients>
  1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 cup granulated sugar, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 3 ripe bananas, mashed, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 cup peaches, peeled and diced, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
 </ingredients>
 <directions>
  Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. Set aside.
In a large bowl, beat together the sugar and eggs until light and fluffy. Gradually add the vegetable oil, continuing to beat. Stir in the mashed bananas and vanilla extract until well combined.
Gradually add the dry ingredients to the banana mixture, stirring just until the flour is incorporated. Do not overmix.
Fold in the diced peaches and chopped walnuts, if using. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven for 60-70 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean.
Allow bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Serve as is or with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
