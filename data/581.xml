  Banana Chocolate Chip Bread
 </title>
 <ingredients>
  1 cup granulated sugar, 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder, ½ teaspoon baking soda, ½ teaspoon salt, ½ cup unsalted butter, softened, 2 large eggs, 4 ripe bananas, mashed, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips, Optional: ½ cup chopped walnuts or pecans
 </ingredients>
 <directions>
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
In a large bowl, whisk together sugar, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, cream together butter and eggs until light and fluffy. Stir in mashed bananas and vanilla extract until well mixed.
Fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until just combined. Be careful not to overmix. Gently stir in the chocolate chips, and if desired, the chopped nuts.
Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 60 to 70 minutes.
Allow bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.
