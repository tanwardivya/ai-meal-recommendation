 </ingredients>
 <directions>
  In a small bowl, mix chili powder, smoked paprika, ground cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and salt. Rub the seasoning mix all over the flank steak. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the seasoned flank steak to the skillet. Cook for about 5-7 minutes on each side for medium-rare, or until done to your liking. Remove the steak from skillet and let it rest for 5 minutes. While the steak is resting, add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the skillet. Sauté the bell peppers and onion slices over medium heat until they are tender, about 5-8 minutes. Slice the rested steak against the grain into thin strips. Sprinkle lime juice over the sliced steak. Place some of the steak and sautéed bell peppers and onions onto each warmed low-carb flour tortilla. Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve with lime wedges, salsa, and optional sour cream or guacamole if desired.
