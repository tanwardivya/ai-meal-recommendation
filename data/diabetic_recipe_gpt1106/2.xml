 </recipe_name>
 <ingredients>
  4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, 
        1/2 cup almond flour, 
        1/2 cup sliced almonds, 
        1 teaspoon paprika, 
        1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 
        1/2 teaspoon onion powder, 
        1/4 teaspoon black pepper, 
        1/4 teaspoon salt, 
        2 egg whites, 
        2 tablespoons olive oil
 </ingredients>
 <directions>
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a shallow dish, combine almond flour, sliced almonds, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and salt. In another shallow dish, lightly beat the egg whites, 
        Dip each chicken breast into the egg whites, then into the almond mixture, pressing the mixture onto the chicken to get a good coating, 
        Heat the olive oil in a large, oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken breasts and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side until golden, 
        Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the juices run clear. Ensure the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) when checked with a meat thermometer, 
        Remove from the oven and let rest for a few minutes before serving. Serve hot.
