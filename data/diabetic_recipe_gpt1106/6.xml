  In a mixing bowl, mash the black beans slightly. Stir in shredded cheese, salsa, cilantro, cumin, garlic powder, and chili powder. Spread the mixture evenly onto half of each tortilla. Fold the tortillas in half over the bean mixture to create a half-moon shape. Press gently to seal, Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and lightly coat with cooking spray. Place a filled tortilla in the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side or until the outside is golden brown and the cheese has melted. Repeat with the remaining quesadillas.
