  Balsamic Feta Chicken
 </recipe_name>
 <ingredients>
  4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 1/2 pounds),
        1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper,
        1 tablespoon olive oil,
        1/4 cup balsamic vinegar,
        1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth,
        2 cloves garlic, minced,
        1 teaspoon dried oregano,
        1 teaspoon dried basil,
        1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese,
        1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
 </ingredients>
 <directions>
  Season the chicken breasts with the ground black pepper. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken breasts and cook until browned on both sides, about 5-6 minutes per side.
        Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside, keeping it warm. In the same skillet, add balsamic vinegar, chicken broth, garlic, oregano, and basil. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 5 minutes, until the sauce thickens slightly.
        Return the chicken to the skillet, spooning the sauce over the breasts. Cover and simmer for an additional 7-10 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C).
        Sprinkle the feta cheese over the chicken, cover the skillet for a minute to allow the cheese to soften slightly. Garnish with fresh parsley before serving.
