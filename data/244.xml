  Slow Cooker Cranberry Fig Pork
 </title>
 <ingredients>
  2 pounds pork tenderloin, 
1 teaspoon salt, 
1/2 teaspoon black pepper, 
1 tablespoon olive oil, 
1 cup dried figs, stems removed and quartered, 
1 cup fresh or frozen cranberries, 
1/2 cup brown sugar, 
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, 
1/4 cup water, 
2 cloves garlic, minced, 
1 teaspoon dried rosemary, 
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme,
Optional: Fresh rosemary sprigs for garnish
 </ingredients>
 <directions>
  Season the pork tenderloin all over with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork and sear until brown on all sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the pork to the slow cooker.
In a bowl, mix together dried figs, cranberries, brown sugar, balsamic vinegar, water, minced garlic, dried rosemary, and dried thyme. Pour this mixture over the pork in the slow cooker.
Cover and cook on low for 6 to 8 hours or on high for 3 to 4 hours, until pork is tender and cooked through.
Transfer the pork to a serving dish and let it rest for a few minutes. Meanwhile, skim off any excess fat from the sauce in the slow cooker if needed. Pour the fruit sauce over the pork or serve on the side.
If desired, garnish with fresh rosemary sprigs before serving.
